# Binary search

Ternary search is a divide and conquer algorithm that can be used to find an element in an array. It is similar to binary search where we divide the array into two parts but in this algorithm, we divide the given array into three parts and determine which has the key (searched element). 

__Worst case timing complexity__: O(log3 n)
__Best case of time complexity__: O(1)
