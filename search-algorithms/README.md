# Search Algorithms

## Introduction 

In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm (typically involving a multitude of other, more specific algorithms [1]) which solves a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.

Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

* __Sequential Search__: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: Linear Search.

* __Interval Search__: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Binary Search.
