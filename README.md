# Academic Programming

## Introduction

As I have studied several academic contents in programming, and in these studies I separated the content into different repositories, so I prefer to create a single repository where, I will gather all the contents that I have studied so far, and those that I will study, this initiative serves me as a way to review everything I had studied and keep organized, for future content consultations.

## Contents

> The contents below will be shared here, whenever I conclude something about it.

* [Data structures

## Exercises and implementations

> All content that I will study, I will be putting the implementation here in the repository, organized by content category, and whenever possible together with the content there will also be exercises separated by category.
