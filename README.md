# Academic Programming

![Academic programming](https://tlgur.com/d/g05EPD94)

## Introduction

As I have studied several academic contents in programming, and in these studies I separated the content into different repositories, so I prefer to create a single repository where, I will gather all the contents that I have studied so far, and those that I will study, this initiative serves me as a way to review everything I had studied and keep organized, for future content consultations.

## Contents

> The contents below will be shared here, whenever I conclude something about it.

* Data structures
* Recursive algorithms
* Search algorithms
* Sorting algorithms
* Programming techniques
* Miscellaneous algorithms

## Summary of contents

> You can access the contents organized in summary format by clicking on the link below, there you can access the folder of the content you want.

[Summary](https://github.com/DKSecurity99/academic-programming/blob/main/.github/CONTENT.md)

## Exercises and implementations

> All content that I will study, I will be putting the implementation here in the repository, organized by content category, and whenever possible together with the content there will also be exercises separated by category.

__Example__

``
/data-structures
  -> content
    -> stack
  -> exercises 
    -> stack 
``

## Languages used
