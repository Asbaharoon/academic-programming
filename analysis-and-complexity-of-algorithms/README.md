# Analysis and complexity of algorithms 

## Introduction

In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms â€“ the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity).
