# Analysis and complexity of algorithms 

## Introduction

In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms ‚Äì the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its time complexity) or the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity).
