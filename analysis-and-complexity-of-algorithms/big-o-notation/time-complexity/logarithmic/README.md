# Linear

## Concept

An algorithm is said to run in logarithmic time when the input is divided into "chunks" until it reaches the expected result, decreasing the input factor N, that is the inverse of a quadratic algorithm as is the case with the logarithmic which is the inverse of exponentiation.

In Big O notation the expression is represented by O(log n)
